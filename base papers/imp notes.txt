data pre-processing:
1. If there are categorical columns (e.g., "Yes/No", "Male/Female"):
Encode them into numbers using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
2. Normalize Numerical Data
If the dataset has numerical features with varying scales, normalize them to bring all features into the same range.
Define X and y as shown above.
Check the target values and encode them if necessary.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
